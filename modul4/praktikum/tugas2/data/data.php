Doesn't like people arguing, and is depressed when things are unpleasant. Though she'd like to ease the situation in such cases, she's not really good at reading between the lines. She often went with her grandmother to see the stars on her grandmother's back. Because of that, she has a habit of reaching her arm out to the sky at times, which has led Rintarou to naming it the 'Stardust Shakehand.' She abruptly does this (even if she's talking with someone), which surprises everyone around her.",
